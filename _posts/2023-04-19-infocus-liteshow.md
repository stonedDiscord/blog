title:  "InFocus Liteshow III repurpose"
---

This device is a wireless receiver for presentations.
It uses a wireless dongle or network to transmit video from a laptop to a projector.

Since the dongle is missing from mine, i'm looking into other uses for this thing.

The firmware can be found at https://infocus.com/software/inliteshow3/ but it is in a passworded zip file.
I suspect the device has the password, so i have to get into one using another way.

I connected a USB-Serial adapter to the header on the board and at 38400 baud i get this on startup:

```

So it does run Linux but it disables the serial console right at boot.

The encrypted firmware zip contains a "romfs" file which could very well be the `ROMFS found at 0x46060000, Volume name = mambo` line that shows up 4 times.

Spamming enter did nothing.

I tried bridging some pins on the MX29GL128 flash chip that made it get stuck but it kept booting after releasing the pins.

Next I tried bridging some pins on the NT5DS32M16BS-5T RAM chip, that made it crash after booting.

To get further with this i will probably have to dump the flash chip.
It's a TSOP56 and my reader can only do TSOP48 so I'll have to wait for a new reader to arrive.

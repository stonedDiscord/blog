# Playing physical CD+G on a PC

This was harder than i thought it would be.

I ended up using [Mednafen version 0.9.37-2](https://forum.fobby.net/index.php?t=msg&goto=3814)
because they [removed support for physical media in 0.9.38](https://forum.fobby.net/index.php?t=msg&goto=4639).

The command line arguments are `.\mednafen.exe -force_module pce -physcd D:` and then I had to press `Shift+Alt+1` to map the buttons to a controller because i don't have a numpad where the I and II keys are mapped on the default settings.

I then navigated to the GRAPHICS option on the top right, select a track and press PLAY.
You can then press SELECT to hide the controls.

The manual can be found [here](https://archive.org/details/nec-pc-engine-core-grafx-cd-rom2/page/n17/mode/2up)

The pcfx mode also works, it has slightly more options such as pitch shift.
But some images appear glitched.
On the PC-FX CD the RUN button hides the UI.

KaraFun Player 2 did not work.
It can only read files and an Audio CD doesn't have files on it.
